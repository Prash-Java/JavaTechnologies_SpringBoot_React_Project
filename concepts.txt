For Back-end:
-> Spring Boot With Java And Hibernate With MySql
--> Model, Repository, Exception, Service, Controller Packages
--> Database configurations on application.properties
For Front-end:
-> React On Visual Code Studio
--> create new React Project with command: npx create-react-app <project-name>
--> switch to created project path above: cd <project-name>
--> start the project using the command: npm start
--> Search on the Google search for Bootstrap 4 cdn and copy the css link from there and paste in 
index.html file under <head></head> tag

---> npm install bootstrap --save (and this command on terminal will inject bootstrap 4 dependencies
into the package.json file of the React Project)
